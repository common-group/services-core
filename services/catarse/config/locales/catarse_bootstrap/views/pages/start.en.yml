            question: Why campaign on Catarse?
            answer: Firstly because we are extremely committed and passionate about
              what we do and want to see your project funded. But also because we
              are the first and largest platform in action in Brazil. We are working
              independently to develop the project financing scenario in Brazil and
              enable more people to make their ideas, dreams and visions feasible.
          2:
            question: Is it too hard to have a Catarse campaign?
            answer: Each project in the Catarse has its own particularity and the
              amount of work varies. Registering a project on Catarse is very easy,
              but a campaign has its challenges. The key is to have good campaign
              planning! We can help you! <a href="#start-form">Just start your draft.</a>
          3:
            question: Does Catarse select projects that go on the air?
            answer: No. You create your draft and publish your campaign directly through
              the site, whenever you want. However, there are some <a href="http://suporte.catarse.me/hc/pt-br/articles/202387638-Diretrizes-para-cria%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-projetos">rules
              for creating projects</a> that you must follow so that your project
              has no risk of being reported by the community after publication.
          4:
            question: Who can use Catarse?
            answer: Catarse provides support to site users and makes it possible for
              projects to capture resources quickly and easily using the internet.
              Anyone over 18 (or younger, but with a legal representative) can use
              our services and run a crowdfunding campaign.

          1:
            question: Do I need to reach the goal to receive my money?
            answer: It depends on the type of financing you choose. In the &quot;All
              or Nothing&quot; model, you only get the money if you reach the collection
              goal in the campaign time stipulated by you. If the project does not
              meet the collection goal, we will fully refund the money to your supporters,
              at no cost to you or your supporter. <br><br> Already in the flexible
              financing mode, affectionately called &quot;Flex&quot;, you get all
              the money you can get regardless of hitting the target or not. You can
              better understand the difference between the models and what is the
              ideal for your project in this <a href="http://fazum.catarse.me/tudoounada-ou-flex?ref=ctrse_start">eBook
              we prepare.</a>
          2:
            question: What are our rates?
            answer: In the All or Nothing model, Catarse charges only 13% of the total
              amount collected if you reach 100% or more of your goal. Otherwise,
              we will refund the money to the supporters and will not charge anyone
              anything. <br><br> In the Flex model, Catarse charges 13% of the total
              collected by the campaign. If the project does not collect anything,
              there will be no charge. <br><br> If you want to know why we charge
              this commission and where we invest our money, check out our <a href="http://crowdfunding.catarse.me/nossa-taxa?ref=ctrse_start">special
              (and transparent!) Page talking about our rate.</a>
          3:
            question: Where does the money from my project come from?
            answer: Family, friends, fans and members of communities that you are
              part of are your greatest contributors. You shake this network, win
              support and promote the project. Supporters publicize and recommend
              their campaign to others they know, and so the circle of supporters
              grows and the campaign gets support. The key is to build a good project,
              plan your campaign well and know how to target your outreach efforts
              to those who really care about what you are proposing in your crowdfunding
              campaign.
